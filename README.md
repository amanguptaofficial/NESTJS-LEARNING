# NESTJS-LEARNING

Welcome to my learning repository for the **NestJS** framework!

In this repository, I am learning **NestJS** step by step, covering all essential concepts, features, and best practices for building server-side applications with **NestJS** and **Node.js**.

## What is NestJS?

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework built with TypeScript, designed to build scalable and maintainable server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript features, and its architecture is heavily inspired by Angular, allowing developers to create highly modular and reusable code.

## Contents

Here is a step-by-step guide of the topics I am covering as I learn NestJS:

1. **Introduction to NestJS**  
   - Understanding the core concepts of NestJS
   - Installation and setup of NestJS
   - Creating a basic NestJS application

2. **Modules and Controllers**  
   - Working with modules in NestJS
   - Creating and organizing controllers

3. **Providers and Services**  
   - Creating services and injecting them into controllers
   - Dependency Injection in NestJS

4. **Routing and Middleware**  
   - Setting up routes and handling HTTP requests
   - Using middleware for request handling

5. **Pipes, Guards, and Interceptors**  
   - Understanding and using pipes for input validation
   - Implementing guards for authorization
   - Using interceptors for logging and transformations

6. **Database Integration**  
   - Integrating NestJS with databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
   - Using TypeORM or Mongoose for data management

7. **Authentication and Authorization**  
   - Implementing JWT authentication
   - Setting up roles-based authorization

8. **WebSockets**  
   - Working with real-time communication using WebSockets

9. **Testing in NestJS**  
   - Unit testing and integration testing with NestJS
   - Using Jest for testing

10. **Deployment**  
    - Deploying a NestJS application to platforms like Heroku or AWS

## How to Follow Along

You can follow along with this repository by checking out the specific chapters and code examples. The code is organized into individual steps that correspond to each topic, so feel free to explore and experiment with the examples.

### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need the following:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **TypeScript** (NestJS uses TypeScript by default)

### Installation

To install NestJS globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
